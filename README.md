DR TV channels

An Android app that implements a TV Input Service for DR TV to allow its channels to be added to the Android TV Live Channels app.

The input service adds EPG channel data to Live Channels and allows for live playback. Just install the DR channels app, open Live Channels on Android TV and go to Settings->Channel sources and setup DR TV channels as a source.

THe DR MU-online API version 1.4 is implemented in its own module "drapi" so that it can easily be used in other projects.
